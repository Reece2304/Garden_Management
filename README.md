**UPDATE 05/05/21:** I am working on recreating the trefle API but in the meantime I have changed some code (only in the final_build.zip) that will allow you to still use the program as intended (apart from the search functionalities) However, when you click on a plant in the system its details will be null (because I used the trefle api to get the plant's details). But you are still able to create a log for a given plant and change its watering frequency.
